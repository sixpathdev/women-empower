<p>We had some spooky Halloween fun this Friday at Women&#8217;s Empowerment. Our students, staff, and children in the CDC got into the Halloween spirit this year by dressing up in some fun costumes. To kick off the Halloween weekend, the children in the CDC went from office to office and trick or treated with the staff.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Donna Valentine for bringing pumpkin muffins for a fun fall-inspired Fri-YAY snack for our students. A perfect way to end this haunted weekend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Graduate Gala Celebration</strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">Strong, capable, spirited, and diligent are just a few words we use to describe our graduates who have overcome adversity and hardships. Women who were once experiencing homelessness have now gone on to find stable jobs, safe housing, and receive the care they need, and we think that&#8217;s incredible. Each day, we are inspired by their ever-growing accomplishments and willingness to achieve even more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We had the chance to celebrate the accomplishments of our hard-working graduates at our grad gala. On this dazzling night, our graduates had a blast as they dressed up and enjoyed a live DJ, a delicious catered meal, a fun photo booth, raffle prizes, and more. Take a look at some of the fun below!</p>
