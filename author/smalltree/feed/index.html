Greetings Women&#8217;s Empowerment Community,</p>
<p>At Women&#39;s Empowerment, we are deeply committed to the health and success of the women and children we serve, as well as our staff, volunteers, and donors. We are all part of one community. In a move to fight the spread of the Coronavirus, a shelter in place directive was issued from Sacramento County Health Officials.</p>
<p>In response, Women&#39;s Empowerment is shifting the way we serve women and children experiencing homelessness. Our mission throughout this crisis is to continue to be a trusted resource and provide comprehensive services for women and children experiencing homelessness.</p>
<p>During this crisis, our social workers, employment specialists, housing locator, and child development specialists will be meeting one-on-one with students and graduates primarily by phone, or video conferencing to work with them, support them, and help them achieve their goals. These are challenging times for all of us, but especially for those who don’t have a safe place to call home.</p>
<p>During this difficult time, we are available to support graduates and their families in the following ways:</p>
<p><b>We are here to connect</b></p>
<p>Graduates of our program will continue working towards their goals of gaining stable housing and employment to care for themselves and their children. We have staff available to provide access to employment and new housing opportunities. We will also provide training for women on how to utilize remote communication tools as needed in order to practice social distancing. Staff are also putting together and delivering care packages with essential supplies like food, masks, hygiene supplies, notes of encouragement, and more for women and children who need them.</p>
<p><b>We are here to listen</b></p>
<p>Mental health challenges may be even more difficult during this period of uncertainty. We are committed to providing the social and emotional support our graduates need. Our social workers will be available to listen, problem solve, and make referrals when needed.</p>
<p><b>We are here to inform</b></p>
<p>Factual and real time information will be critical to stay healthy and safe. We will be a trusted resource for sharing information about COVID-19 precautions, protocols, and resources.</p>
<p>We know that homeless women and their children will lean on us for support as they continue to strive towards their goals. We also know that more women will need our services when this crisis ends.</p>
<p>Together we will rise to meet this challenge. Moving through these next weeks requires all of us to exercise patience, kindness, and generosity.<br />
We are so grateful for all the ways you support Women’s Empowerment.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p><em>Women&#8217;s Empowerment Team</em></p>
<p>If you have any questions or want more information on how you can support Women’s Empowerment and the community we serve during this difficult time please email support@women-empoertment.org</p>

<h3>Katrina&#8217;s Story: Rebuilding Hope</h3>
<p>When Katrina left her boyfriend, young daughter in tow, her mom and dad took them in and helped raise her daughter. But years later when her father died and a family secret was exposed, Katrina’s family fell apart – along with her life.</p>
<p>She began drinking to cope with anxiety and depression and eventually found herself homeless, sleeping on an alcoholic friend’s couch.</p>
<p>“I realized I was trying to kill myself with alcohol, and it wasn’t working,” Katrina said. “I was suffering so badly and I remember thinking I should get a gun but I wouldn’t have the courage to shoot myself. So I decided to go to rehab instead.”</p>
<p>Through her rehabilitation program, Katrina learned about Women’s Empowerment. She enrolled and began to regain the self-esteem and courage she had lost. When she graduated from the initial nine-week job-readiness program, she joined Women’s Empowerment’s REstart paid training program in property management.</p>
<div id="attachment_106" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-106" src="https://womens-empowerment.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/KatrinaNikkyIyana-300x196.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="196" class="size-medium wp-image-106" /><p id="caption-attachment-106" class="wp-caption-text">Sacramento portrait photography and commercial advertising photography at the 19J Midtown Apartments</p></div>
<p>“I had a friend who had done property management,” Katrina said. “I love people and I like the community aspect of it, so it sounded like a good fit for a new start.”</p>
<p>Upon finishing the training program, Katrina was hired as one of the first property managers to live and work at the new innovative 19j Apartments in Midtown Sacramento. 19j builder, Nikky Mohanna, has committed to hiring five property managers from Women’s Empowerment’s REstart program each year for the next 10 years, providing each with invaluable work experience, a competitive salary, and an apartment in the building.</p>
<p>“I think this partnership is awesome,” Katrina said. “Nikky had a beautiful vision when she thought of hiring women who didn’t have a chance to have our own place in an A-list property. I love downtown life and my own little space.”</p>
<p>With a fresh start at life, Katrina also is finding a fresh start with family. Her daughter is proud of the changes she has made, and her sister recently came to visit.</p>
<p>“All of these wonderful things are happening that I didn’t expect,” Katrina said. “I love my life now. It kind of feels like I’m dreaming. I feel like I have somewhere to belong and people who care. If you’ve been as low as I have and picked yourself up and gained the things I have, you know anything’s possible.”</p>

<h4>Robin&#8217;s Story: How a Recently Homeless Mom Got a Job With The Legislature</h4>
<p>One of the greatest Women’s Empowerment traditions is the ringing of the job bell when a women secures employment. Robin recently picked up this bell and shared her story with current Women’s Empowerment students…</p>
<p>She and her husband were pursuing degrees at Sacramento State University, working steady jobs, and growing their own business when the unexpected happened. </p>
<p>Her husband began having a series of epileptic seizures that left him incapacitated. Robin had to give up college and work to be his primary caregiver. She watched her family’s hard-earned money disappear as they struggled to survive—and as medical bills piled higher. They sold all of their furniture and electronics, and eventually lost their car and home.</p>
<p>Robin was in her second trimester of pregnancy. Not only did she have herself and her recuperating husband to care for, she had her son to think about.</p>
<p>Robin immediately began filling out applications for apartments, affordable housing and even shelters—nothing was available. They rented motel rooms and turned to family and acquaintances for shelter.</p>
<p>Then a good friend mentioned Women’s Empowerment. She had graduated from the program, and knew Women’s Empowerment would help Robin rebuild her life.</p>
<p>The support and encouragement Robin found was exactly what she needed. Women’s Empowerment provided transportation assistance and onsite childcare for her infant son, so Robin could focus on honing her job-readiness skills.</p>
<p>“It was the first time in over a year that I could even imagine finding some hope to live a life that I felt was good again,” she said.</p>
<p>After graduating from Women’s Empowerment, Robin continued to work with her Employment Specialist to secure a part-time paid internship at a California Assemblymember’s office.</p>
<p>In just four short months, Robin was promoted from her internship to a full-time position as a District Field Representative. “Because Sacramento is my hometown, I feel privileged to have the opportunity to make a difference in my community. This is where I grew up, and I want it to be a good place for my child to grow up,” she said. Robin even represented her office at Governor Brown’s bill-signing ceremony held at Women’s Empowerment last month.</p>
<p>Less than a year after graduating from Women’s Empowerment, Robin has a full-time job with full benefits, a car, and—after two years of being on waitlists—her own apartment. She and her husband even created a college savings account for her son. Robin couldn’t be more grateful this Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Because of your support, Robin is not alone in her accomplishments. 81% of our graduates secure a job or enroll in school, and 92% find a safe place to call home.</p>
<p>Please consider giving a gift of $100 to Women’s Empowerment to ensure families like Robin’s have an opportunity to succeed. You are an integral part of the solution to ending homelessness—right here—right now.</p>
